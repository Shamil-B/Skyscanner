## This is a simple React app project I created during my virtual project doing experience with Skyscanner. The purpose of this project was to create a user interface for a flight search engine using React.

# Technologies Used
* React
* Html
* CSS

# Getting Started
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
* Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies
* Run npm start to start the development server
* Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the app

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Skyscanner for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project and learn more about React.
